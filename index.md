## About the research group

The major interest of the Molecular Biomechanics group is to decipher how proteins have been designed to specifically respond to mechanical forces in the cellular environment or as a biomaterial. We use Molecular Dynamics simulations, Force Distribution Analysis, Finite Element Analysis, and other computational techniques to study protein dynamics and mechanics on different length and time scales.
